FIRMWARE:
The firmware is in the ./embedded directory; to compile the code, you must
install MPLAB X (http://www.microchip.com/pagehandler/en-us/family/mplabx/)
as well as Microchip's 16-bit C compiler.  

There are three projects: WellMain.X (the wired to wireless hub),
WellInterface.X (the computer interface), and WellSensor.X (the sensors).
These names are left over from a previous incarnation of this project.

To compile for different sensor type or different network addresses, change
the #define statements in the "config.h" file included in each project.


CONTROLLER:
The core of the controller implementation is in the ./controller/sensornet
Python package.  The sensor-specific data is in ./controller/sensorDefs.py,
which is directly imported by the sample application.

The example application is in ./controller/test.py, which specifies the sensors
and serial port that it expects near the top of the file.  The sample
application simply changes the color of the LED output at address 20 based on
the reading at the light sensor at address 21.

The command line interface is in ./controller/sensorCmd.py, which similarly
hardcodes the available sensors and serial port.  It supports the following
commands:

list: shows a list of sensors, including address, index within the sensor,
and a short description of the sensor type.

read <addr> <index>: reads the value from the specified sensor.  For example,
read 21 0
would read the light sensor.

write <addr> <index> <newval>: writes newval into the specified actuator, and
prints the old value, if the actuator is set up to do so.

quit: exits the command line interface
